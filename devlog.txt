11.9.24 
  - Project initialized from webpack-react-template.
  - Boilerplate made - added date-fns.
  - Data fetch functions made.
    - Need to figure out how data should be used.
     - Data will probably be sent directly to the page to update.
     - Maybe push data into an array to lower api calls.
      - Add logic to search through data first before making a call? 
  - Logic is already set for retrieving the data and how to update the ui. 
  - Webpage layout needed to proceed. 
  - Keep things simple?
  - Download svg - https://www.amcharts.com/free-animated-svg-weather-icons/
    - In assets folder.
  - Tried updating webpack config to have assets show.
  - Updated webpack to handle svgs and animated svgs.
  - Need to finish updateMain.
  - Need to update logic for icons.
